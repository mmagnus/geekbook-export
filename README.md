## Create a new github repository
Go to https://github.com/new and type a name of your new repository, e.g., geekbook-export (you can make it public if you want, but then everyone can see your export, so mind that).

Go to a place where you want to keep your repo (/Users/magnus/Desktop/) and run

	(py37) [mx] Desktop$ git clone git@github.com:mmagnus/geekbook-export.git
	Cloning into 'geekbook-export'...
	warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.

Now, go to `geekbook/engine` and run  `page.py`:

	python page.py /Users/magnus/Desktop/geekbook-export geekbook-export.md --add-toc --push

You should see something like this:

```
